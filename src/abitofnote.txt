/* This is a LCD library based on HD44780U for Arduino(clones, compatible) boards. It is purely written in C as opposed to the standard Arduino LCD library * which is written in C++. This library is very simple and straightforward. There is no huge amount of methods to pass a value which makes the code hard to *read. Besides improving my C programming skill in the development of this library, it is also aimed to provide a library that even is not directly portable to other microcontrollers which use C, it will still be able to do so with just minor modifications. I do realize however this code is pretty much hardcoded and will always be criticized by any C++ programmers. Question like "why use C when Arduino supports C++(though, not fully C++)" is expected. This library is a platform for me to enhance my programming skill, because just reading books and doing practice aren't fun enough. I got my hand dirty and it was benefitting(well, at least for me). Last but not least, share the library, improve it, make modifications to adjust your needs, and again spread it. Even when a lot of people won't find it useful, there is perhaps at least, one person might need it. Who knows? */
