# Project LCD_Rewrite

This project is my attempt to rewrite entire Arduino LCD library in C language.

This project serves two purposes:
  1. As a platform to enhance my poor C programming.
  2. To allow portability with minor changes when used on different microcontrollers that only support C.
  
The library is based on HD44780U datasheet. The library is complete. Available in 4-bit and 8-bit modes.
