# Project LCD_Rewrite

This project is my attempt to rewrite entire Arduino LCD library in C language.

This project serves two purposes:
  1. As a platform to enhance my poor C programming.
  2. To allow portability with minor changes when used on different microcontrollers that only support C.
  
Current version only wors in 8-bit mode. I will be porting 4-bit mode in the same source files. The documentation of the code will be updated from time to time.
